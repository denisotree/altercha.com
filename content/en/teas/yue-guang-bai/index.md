Yue Guang Bai, or Moonlight White, is a unique white tea from Yunnan Province. Unlike traditional Fujian white teas, it's made from large-leaf Yunnan tea plants, creating a distinctive appearance with dark backs and silvery fronts, resembling moonlight on leaves.

## Origin

Yunnan Province, China. Produced from ancient tea tree varietals in high-altitude regions. The tea gets its name from the traditional processing method where leaves are dried under moonlight, though modern production uses careful indoor withering to achieve similar results.

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

- **Appearance**: Striking bi-colored leaves - dark on one side, silvery-white on the other
- **Aroma**: Complex and inviting with notes of dried fruit, honey, and subtle spice
- **Flavor**: Rich and sweet with fruity notes of apricot and peach, hints of cocoa
- **Finish**: Smooth and mellow with a pleasant sweetness that lingers

## Effects & Benefits

**Tea Superpowers:**
- Balances energy and promotes calm alertness
- Supports digestive comfort
- Rich in antioxidants and polyphenols
- Gentle warming effect on the body
- Enhances mood and emotional balance

This tea creates a harmonious state of relaxed focus, perfect for evening contemplation or creative pursuits. Its warming nature makes it especially comforting during cooler weather while maintaining mental clarity.

## Brewing Instructions

**Simple brewing method:**
- **For 0.5L**: 4-5g of tea
- **For 1L**: 8-10g of tea
- **Water temperature**: 85-90°C (185-194°F)
