GABA Oolong Fujian is a functional tea specially processed in an oxygen-free environment to naturally increase its GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) content. This Fujian-style GABA oolong combines the traditional character of Chinese oolongs with enhanced calming properties, making it both delicious and beneficial for stress relief.

## Origin

Fujian Province, China. GABA tea was developed in Japan in the 1980s and adopted by Taiwanese and Chinese tea makers. The tea undergoes anaerobic processing (fermentation without oxygen) which causes the tea leaves to naturally produce high levels of GABA, a neurotransmitter known for its calming effects. This Fujian version uses local oolong cultivars.
