## Brewing Instructions

**Simple brewing method:**
- **For 0.5L**: 4-5g of tea (break off pieces from cake - young sheng is potent!)
- **For 1L**: 8-10g of tea
- **Water temperature**: 85-90°C (185-194°F) - avoid boiling water
- **Steeping time**: 1-2 minutes (rinse first with hot water for 5 seconds, discard)
- **Re-steeping**: Can be steeped 12-20 times

Fresh sheng pu-erh requires careful brewing to avoid excessive bitterness. Use lower temperature and shorter steeping times. The tea can become bitter if over-steeped, so adjust to your preference. Each infusion reveals different facets, with sweetness dominating in middle steepings.
