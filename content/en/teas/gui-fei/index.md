Gui Fei, meaning "Concubine" or "Noble Lady," is a unique Taiwanese oolong that develops its distinctive honey-sweet character through natural interaction with tea jassids (small insects). This creates a complex, fruity profile unlike any other tea, with natural honey sweetness and no bitterness.

## Origin

Taiwan (primarily Nantou County). This tea is produced when small leafhoppers bite the tea leaves, triggering the plant's natural defense response that creates unique aromatic compounds. The tea requires specific environmental conditions and careful processing to develop its characteristic honey and fruit notes. Similar in style to Oriental Beauty (Bai Hao Oolong).

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

- **Appearance**: Multi-colored leaves with white, green, brown, and red hues
- **Aroma**: Intense honey sweetness with ripe fruit, muscatel grape, and floral notes
- **Flavor**: Naturally sweet with prominent honey character, ripe peach, apricot, and subtle spice
- **Finish**: Long-lasting sweetness with no astringency, smooth and luxurious

## Effects & Benefits

**Tea Superpowers:**
- Promotes relaxation and emotional comfort
- Gentle, warming energy without stimulation
- Uplifts mood with natural sweetness
- Rich in unique antioxidant compounds
- Supports stress relief and contentment
- Creates a sense of luxury and indulgence

This tea creates a state of blissful relaxation and contentment - perfect for unwinding, social gatherings, or treating yourself to something special. Its natural sweetness and lack of bitterness make it universally appealing and mood-enhancing.

## Brewing Instructions

**Simple brewing method:**
- **For 0.5L**: 4-5g of tea
- **For 1L**: 8-10g of tea
- **Water temperature**: 85-90°C (185-194°F)

Gui Fei is extremely forgiving and will never turn bitter. Lower water temperature preserves the delicate honey and fruit notes. Each infusion maintains the sweet character. Excellent for afternoon or evening enjoyment, and pairs beautifully with desserts.
