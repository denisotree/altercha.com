Da Hong Pao Hua Xiang is a floral-style Big Red Robe from the Wuyi Mountains, one of China's most famous rock oolongs. This version emphasizes the natural floral aromatics while maintaining the characteristic mineral complexity of Wuyi rock teas. The lighter roast allows the tea's inherent floral notes to shine through.

## Origin

Wuyi Mountains, Fujian Province, China. Grown in the rocky terrain that gives Wuyi oolongs their distinctive "rock charm" (yan yun). The tea plants absorb minerals from the rocky soil, creating unique flavor complexity. This floral version receives a lighter roast to preserve delicate aromatic compounds.
